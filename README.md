# Direct_Detection_with_Phase_Recovery

This work tries to impelemnt a decoder for channel with Direct Detection that recovers, up to some point, the phase of the transmitted symbols.

The system model is based on [1] and the decoder is a machine learning based system inspired in the DetNet architecture presented in [2] and [3]. 

For more details see the [report](Report/main.pdf).
