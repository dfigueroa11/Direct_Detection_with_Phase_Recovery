In this report, we introduce the phase recovery problem in optical communications with Direct Detection (DD), review some papers that study the information capacity of channels under DD, and show that the capacity loss is at most 1 bit compared with the coherent detection. Then, we review two proposed systems that try to recover the phase when using DD. Finally, we propose a detector for one of these systems based on machine learning with the hope of reducing the complexity of the decoder. Unfortunately, the performance of the proposed decoder, in terms of the SER, is not as good as expected because the decoder presents a high error floor. However, it opens the door for exploring decoders based on machine learning, so we propose some possible future work for testing different architectures.
